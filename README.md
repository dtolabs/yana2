# Yana: Yet another node authority!

You didn't have one or you wanted another node authority. 

## Overview

Yana strives to offer a simple and basic node metadata service.

## Concepts

The basic concept of Yana is a "Node" which represents a host on the network.
Information about a node can be defined using an "Attribute", a simple
name/value pair. The concept of "Tag" provides a method to match
Nodes based on a symbolic name.

## Interfaces

The primary interface to Yana, is its WebAPI but there is also
a rudimentary HTML-based graphical interface.
