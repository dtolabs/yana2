You didn't have one or you wanted another node authority. 

## Overview

Yana strives to offer a simple and basic node metadata service.

## Concepts

The basic concept of Yana is a "Node" which represents an object in a network.
Nodes are defined in terms of a "NodeType" which defines a set of attributes
about a node.

## Interfaces

The primary interface to Yana, is its WebAPI but there is also
a rudimentary HTML-based graphical interface.
