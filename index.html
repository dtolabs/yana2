              <h1>Welcome to Yet Another Node Authority!</h1>

              <h3>Why do I need yet another node authority?</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Do you need an independent information source that contains information about hosts, VMs, services,  software deployments,  configurations and dependencies?</li>
                <li>Do you need that information to be specified and be accessible by different tools and as a source you consider to be authoritative?</li>
                <li>Do you want to describe things about your application and infrastructure using a bare bones non-opinioned model that let's you specify things in your own opinionated way?</li>
              </ul>

              <p>YANA is a super simple, bare bones model management service where you specify, store and manage administrative information using an object graph. YANA is like a drafting board that lets you define and manage your model as specifications.
                Use YANA as a place to visualize and navigate the management information and put it all together into a single model.
              </p>
              <p>YANA provides a plain jane GUI for viewing and modifying the model. YANA provides access control to govern who can change what parts of the model. YANA includes an API and export/import services to interact with the model from other tools and systems.</p>


              <p>YANA is a super simple thing, that lets you do a not-always-super-simple thing, describe your world.  YANA lets you create object graphs that represent your online software systems as interconected Nodes. Nodes are described with Attributes and Relationships as declared by thier Type. The YANA model objects can be declared via API or XML documents.
                YANA only takes responsibility to store, update, query, export and import the model. 
                YANA enables easy "integration" with other services  via a RESTy API and XML document support.
                </p>
              <p>A YANA model is a specification of your world. It's the model of your world state.   You can't represent the world as it is because it's always changing but you can represent the  way you want the world to be.  YANA let's you create an a-priori definition of expected state.  With YANA you can specify environmental state or represent state definitions be they about configurations, properties, dependencies, etc. Tools can be controlled by the state in the YANA model or even change the model's state.
                </p>



              <h3>Other Node Authorities</h3>
              <p>YANA is not unique as a Node Authority. There are many other tools and services
                that support maintaining a node model. For example, configuration management tools
                like CFEngine, Puppet, and Chef  are each capable of collecting and storing information
                about infrastructure and applications. This information is then made available to
                the automation layer and makes actions data-driven and thus more reusable.
              </p>
              <p>ITIL declares the concept of a "CMDB" containing information about how business
                systems are comprised of interconnected components. This information is important
                for Service Management concerns like incident, problem, change and capacity management.
              </p>
              <p>Infrastructure as a Service environments all include a Node Authority that knows about the
                virtual machines they control. The VM life cycle, from launch to retirement are
                governed by the compute service controller. This controller is the absolute truth
                about the state of the hosts.
              </p>

              <p>Tools like Zookeeper allow you to define object graphs that model the structure
                of your application. The graph can be made active and invoke actions when the
                graph changes. These graphs are useful for the application to self-configure.
                </p>

              <p>Monitoring tools like Zenoss, allow you to model your environment from network
                layer to service layer, letting you also define relationships
                between objects. This is important because these "run-time service models"
                are essential to understand how faults can impact the broader environment.
              </p>
              <p>Your house-built system management tools probably include multiple Node Authorities.
                Inventory databases, deployment consoles, alarm managers each contain a view
                of the environment and the applications that run in it. These tools might be built
                from using libraries like neo4j that make it easy to implement object graph
                data structures.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each of the Node Authorities named above are useful and share an important common purpose,
                to represent the structure and properties of an environment. 
                YANA is yet another Node Authority, but just that. YANA is not active. YANA just
                provides basic CRUD, import/export, and access control. You can use YANA as
                a generic node model representation when you need to share specifications between one or more tools.
              </p>

              <h3>Modeling with YANA</h3>

              <p>YANA only gives you a basic set of objects to specify things in your domain: Nodes, Types, Attributes and Relationships. </p>

                <p>
                  <b>Node</b>: A Node is an object in the graph. It may or not be connected to another
                  Node by a Relationship. It may have few or many Attributes describing its
                  characteristics and state. Nodes have an inherent feature called <i>tags</i>
                  that take a list of labels useful for loose classification or grouping needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Type</b>: A Node Type is a template specifying a kind of Node. A Node's
                  allowable Attributes and Relationshps are declared by the Node Type.
                  A YANA Node Type is different than a type in a programming language like
                  Ruby or Java. YANA Type's do not support specialization or generalization
                  through inheritance or composition. Node Types are like a frame that defines
                  the permissible "slots" for attributes and relationships.
                </p>
                <p><b>Relationship</b>: A Relationship represents a connection between two Nodes.
                  It is said in this relationship there is a Parent and a Child. This is just
                  a matter of perspective but is often useful to know. 
                </p>

                <p><b>Attribute</b>: A Node Attribute defines a property about a Node.
                  An Attribute is a key/value pair who's value is restricted by
                  a Filter.
                </p>



              <p>These four basic concepts are enough to create a YANA model. Nothing beats some pictures so how about some?
              </p>
              <p>
                Here's some drawings showing the basic YANA modeling objects and how they work together.
                Using those objects we can define Types and Nodes to represent application environments.
              </p>
              <p>The first drawing shows the model primitives and how they are used together.
                Two Nodes, "node A" and "node B", have a relationship where "node A" has a child, "node B".
                One can also see "node A" has an attribute with a "value" that defines some state.
                To the left, one can see "Type A" reflects the model for "node A" and "node B".
                The Type declares one attribute and one type of relationship.
              </p>
              <p>
                <img src="images/metamodel.png" alt="meta model"/>
                <img src="images/model-example-types.png" alt="meta model"/>
                <img src="images/model-example.png" alt="model example types"/>

              </p>
              <p>The second drawing shows a model describing a set of Nodes representing the information about some customer application instances. It shows several columns, each one for Nodes of a given Node Type.
                The 
                "CentosHost" Nodes, centos01 and centos02,   represent the hosts serving the "JBoss" nodes,
                jboss-5 and jboss-6. Several "AppInstance" Nodes represent JBoss application instances. The
                "OracleRDB" Node, represents an Oracle database instance. 
                The "Customer" Nodes represent the business service Nodesrovisioned for the customers, 
                A, B and C.
              </p>
              <p>The third drawing shows the Nodes connected through Relationships. 
                Relations are used to compose Nodes together to form larger structures.
                Note,
                YANA models can arrange Nodes into hierarchies but practically speaking,
                YANA models often take the form of networks.
              </p>

              <p>Overlaying the application model, an administrator may enhance the model
                to apply tags to Nodes or create their own Nodes to represent points of control.
              </p>

              <h3>Using YANA</h3>

              <p>The first step towards building a YANA model is to define the Node Types
                and necessary Attributes. Attributes can be shared across Types so think
                of them like properties which can be general and shared. Once Node Types
                have been declared the next stage begins by defining the Relationships
                between the Nodes of the declared Types. One might consider the 
                type definiton layer, the Node Types
                and Attributes, to be like the "schema" of the model.
              </p>
              <p>In the drawing below, one can see a model spec coming from a git repository
                (could be another source code management system)
                and, via the YANA API, the model spec is imported to the YANA database. Models are stored
                in a YANA project and thus the project name is a parameter to the import function.
                YANA considers it a good practice to maintain the type definition layer 
                as an artifact in the source repository and formally released to YANA instances.
                YANA instances can share model data through an export/import process as one
                can see in the top left of the drawing.
                One might share a set of base types across a number of projects.

                On the right hand side of the drawing, are Monitoring and Deployment tools which
                interact with the YANA db via the REST API and the exchange of model specs.
                A Monitoring tool might modify the YANA model to reflect operational state.
                One might imagine the Monitoring tool is updating Nodes based on operational
                tests.
                The Deployment tool does gets information about a set of Nodes as a listing
                (perhaps based on search queries) and uses the model spec during its remote
                execution across a set of Hosts.

                              or attribute. Rather than maintain this host inventory in scripted code, a YANA
                              model can be used to independently represent the host information and provide it to tools.

                              Infrastructure changes fast (especially in virtual ones) so the YANA model
